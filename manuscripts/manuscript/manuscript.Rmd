# Abstract

#### While the overall optimal builds for Mario Kart 8 are generally agreed upon, most players would rather select their favorite character with an optimal kart build. This project seeks to determine the optimal kart builds for each character, creating an easy way for players to choose a character they like and a build that they can win races with [@noauthor_mario_nodate].

**Key-words**: mario-kart, optimization
